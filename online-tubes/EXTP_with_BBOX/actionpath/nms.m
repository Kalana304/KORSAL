function pick = nms(boxes, overlap)
% Non-maximum suppression.
%   pick = nms(boxes, overlap) 
% 
%   Greedily select high-scoring detections and skip detections that are 
%   significantly covered by a previously selected detection.
%
% Return value
%   pick      Indices of locally maximal detections
%
% Arguments
%   boxes     Detection bounding boxes (see pascal_test.m)
%   overlap   Overlap threshold for suppression
%             For a selected box Bi, all boxes Bj that are covered by 
%             more than overlap are suppressed. Note that 'covered' is
%             is |Bi \cap Bj| / |Bj|, not the PASCAL intersection over 
%             union measure.
